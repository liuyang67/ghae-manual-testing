          - On a string of 3 words, place the cursor within the middle of the middle word (no whitespace. This serves to highlight the word)

            - [ ] *Bold* icon and cmd+b inserts `**` on either side of the word
            - [ ] *Italic* icon and cmd+i inserts `_` on either side of the word
            - [ ] *Quote* places each of the 3 words on their own line, separated by hard-returns and the middle word is now prefixed by `> `
            - *Link* and cmd+k
              - [ ] Keeps all 3 words inline
              - [ ] Wraps the middle word in `[]`
              - [ ] Suffixes `]` with `(url)` and leaves `url` highlighted
            - [ ] *Code* icon inserts back-ticks on either side of the word

            - [ ] *Bulleted* icon prefixes `- ` to the first two lines and pushes the third line under a hard-return
